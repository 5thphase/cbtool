# Welcome to the Cloud Rapid Experimentation and Analysis Toolkit

This toolkit is designed for rapid, large-scale experimentation in the Cloud.

If you don't have a *running* cloud, you can't use it.

( If you're not planning to run more than a handful of VMs, then this tool is really not for you. )

## To get started:

1. [START HERE: Go to the README](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/START-HERE:-README:-Getting-Started-on-the-Command-Line) first for startup documentation on how to begin using the tool from the command-line
2. Read our latest paper (to appear in IC2E 2013).
3. Try to get connected with the [Graphical Wizard](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Using-the-Wizard-for-first-time-connection)
4. Try administrating the tool with the [Graphical Environment](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Using-the-Graphical-Environment)
5. Then try [monitoring your experiments with the Graphical Environment](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Monitoring-with-the-Graphical-Environment)
6. Try to [save experimental results to CSV files on the commandline](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Save-Monitoring-Data-on-the-Command-Line)

## Features:

1. It runs actual multi-tier benchmarks (both IBM and non-IBM software).
2. It can orchestrate different arrival rates and lifetimes using probability distributions.
3. It exercises all of the components of the Cloud, including hosts, virtual machines, and their applications.
4. It has integrated monitoring of application and system performance.
5. It is designed from the ground up to be highly-scalable and parallel.

## Supported Clouds:

1. Amazon
2. OpenStack
3. IBM SCP and IBM Tivoli
4. Libvirt (for machines without clouds)
5. VMWare vCloud (in progress)
