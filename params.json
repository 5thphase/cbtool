[Perform the initial installation](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Initial-Installation)\r\n2. [Run the tool for the first time](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Running-the-tool-for-the-first-time)\r\n3. [Prepare a VM image to be used with the tool](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Preparing-a-VM-to-be-used-with-CloudBench-on-a-real-cloud)\r\n4. [Run simple experiments](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Run-simple-experiments)\r\n5. Read our latest paper (to appear in IC2E 2013).\r\n6. Try to get connected with the [Graphical Wizard](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Using-the-Wizard-for-first-time-connection)\r\n7. Try administrating the tool with the [Graphical Environment](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Using-the-Graphical-Environment)\r\n8. Then try [monitoring your experiments with the Graphical Environment](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Monitoring-with-the-Graphical-Environment)\r\n9. Try to [save experimental results to CSV files on the commandline](https://github.com/ibmcb/cbtool/wiki/HOWTO:-Save-Monitoring-Data-on-the-Command-Line)\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n- Automatic deployment and controlled execution of multiple multi-tier applications.\r\nEach individual application can have a specific load profile using probability distributions.\r\n- Adapters for multiple clouds (EC2 and OpenStack, among others), with a plugin structure that allows new cloud models to be added incrementally.\r\n- Can orchestrate different arrival rates and lifetimes for VMs using probability distributions.\r\n- Collects application and system (OS) performance data from hosts and guests in real time.\r\n- It is designed from the ground up to be highly scalable and parallel.\r\n\r\n## Supported Clouds:\r\n\r\n1. Amazon EC2\r\n2. OpenStack\r\n3. IBM SCP and IBM SCE\r\n4. \"pure\" Libvirt+KVM or Libvirt+XEN (soon)\r\n5. VMWare vCloud (in progress)\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n\r\nMarcio Silva marcios@us.ibm.com","name":"cbtool","tagline":"Cloud Rapid Experimentation and Analysis Toolkit","google":""}
