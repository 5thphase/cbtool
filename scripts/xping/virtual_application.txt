# VApp-specific MANDATORY attributes
DESCRIPTION = Deploys a pair of VMs (sender and receiver) and then runs \"ping\"
DESCRIPTION += between them sending a specific number of ICMP packets between these.\n 
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_PROFILE possible values: "icmp".\n
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_LEVEL meaning: number of packets to send\n 
DESCRIPTION +=- LOAD_DURATION meaning: not used, a run ends when all packets are sent.\n
DESCRIPTION +=- COMMENT: One of the "Synthetic" Workloads.
