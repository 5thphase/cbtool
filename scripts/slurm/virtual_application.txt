# VApp-specific MANDATORY attributes
DESCRIPTION =Deploys a Slurm cluster (1 controller instance and N compute instances).\n
DESCRIPTION +=The master node also runs the "XXXX" benchmark, which is used\n
DESCRIPTION +=to submit spark jobs to the cluster.\n
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_PROFILE possible values: TBD1 (tbd tbd tbd), \n
DESCRIPTION +=    and TBD2 (tbd tbd tbd)\n
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_LEVEL meaning: although the specifics vary by load profile,\n
DESCRIPTION +=    it basically represents "amount of data" generated and processed\n
DESCRIPTION +=    by the job.\n 
DESCRIPTION +=  - LOAD_DURATION meaning: not used, a run ends when the slurm job\n
DESCRIPTION +=    is completed.\n
