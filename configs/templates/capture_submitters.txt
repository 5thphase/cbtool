# TYPE: AI type to be captured
# MAX_CAPS_REQS: Maximum number of capture requests generated by this VM Capture Request Submitter that can be present at a given time.
# IAIT: Random distributions specifying inter-VM capture request arrival time
#    IAIT, LIFETIME, LOAD_LEVEL and LOAD_DURATION has multiple formats:
#       randomly distributed values : <distribution name>I<average>I<std dev>I<max>I<min>
#           example: LOAD_DURATION = uniformIXIXI60I90
#       for fixed values :
#           example: LOAD_DURATION = 73
#       monotonically growing/decreasing values <initial value>(+,-,*,/)<factor>
#           example: LOAD_DURATION = 0+10
