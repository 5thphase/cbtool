description: Deploys an 2-tier stack, formed by N "application (Websphere) nodes" VMs
 - if N > 1, then a "load balancer (IHS) node" VM is also deployed -
 and one "database (DB2) node" VM, and then runs the DayTrader benchmark on the
stack. The actual load is performed by an additional VM, running the WebSphere
Studio Workload Simulator (iwlengine).
- LOAD_PROFILE possible values: "default" (the only profile that we have
registered in the iwlengine).- LOAD_LEVEL meaning: number of clients
simultaneously performing transactions (parameter "-c" on iwlengine).
- LOAD_DURATION meaning: total transaction time for all clients.
- COMMENT: None.
