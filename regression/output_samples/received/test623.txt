 status: Multiple samples of management metrics for all VMs were found (the file /home/msilva/cloudbench/lib/auxiliary//../../data/REGRESSION_B/VM_management_REGRESSION_B.csv will *NOT* be empty).
 status: This experiment was created with a trace file, which will also be included alongside the extracted metrics.
 status: This experiment was run right after a "hard reset".Will also include all logs files (from the Log Store) alongside the extracted metrics.
Monitor extraction success. All metrics written to csv files on the directory "/home/msilva/cloudbench/lib/auxiliary//../../data".
