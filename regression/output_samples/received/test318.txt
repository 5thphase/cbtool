Going to wait until the value on counter "AI ARRIVED" is equal to 30 (currently it is equal to 29) waiting 5.0 seconds between samples. The counter is assumed to be increasing.
 status: Counter "AI ARRIVED" equals 29 after 5 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
 status: Counter "AI ARRIVED" equals 30 after 10 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
Waited 10 seconds until "AIs ARRIVED" was equal to 30.
