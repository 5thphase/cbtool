Background operation execution success. Operation "vm-attach" will be processed asynchronously, through the command ""/home/msilva/cloudbench/lib/operations//../../cbact" --procid=TEST_msilva --osp=port:6379,experiment_inst:TEST_msilva,host:9.2.208.21,pid:TEST_msilva,dbid:10,timout:70,protocol:TCP,kind:redis,username:msilva --msp=port:27017,password:cbpwdZ9,timeout:240,host:9.2.208.21,pid:TEST_msilva,database:metrics,protocol:TCP,kind:mongodb,username:msilva --oop=TESTCLOUD,willfail,auto,empty,default,none,empty=empty --operation=vm-attach --cn=TESTCLOUD --uuid=C78178DE-B1C1-5DC2-9E0C-B2FF7B119630 --daemon". The process id is 433.

Going to wait until the value on counter "VM ARRIVING" is equal to 0 (currently it is equal to 1) waiting 1.0 seconds between samples, for a maximum of 36000.0 seconds. The counter is assumed to be decreasing.
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 0.0125529766083 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 0 after 1.01255297661 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
Waited 1.01255297661 seconds until "VMs ARRIVING" was equal to 0.
