Going to wait until the value on counter "VM ARRIVED" is equal to 8 (currently it is equal to 6) waiting 1.0 seconds between samples, for a maximum of 36000.0 seconds. The counter is assumed to be increasing.
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVED" equals 6 after 0.0379838943481 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVED" equals 8 after 1.03798389435 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
Waited 1.03798389435 seconds until "VMs ARRIVED" was equal to 8.
