Going to start 2 "vmattach" operations in parallel. 
Background operation execution success. Operation "vm-attach" will be processed asynchronously, through the command ""/home/msilva/cloudbench/lib/operations//../../cbact" --procid=TEST_msilva --osp=port:6379,experiment_inst:TEST_msilva,host:9.2.208.21,pid:TEST_msilva,dbid:10,timout:70,protocol:TCP,kind:redis,username:msilva --msp=port:27017,password:cbpwdZ9,timeout:240,host:9.2.208.21,pid:TEST_msilva,database:metrics,protocol:TCP,kind:mongodb,username:msilva --oop=TESTCLOUD,tinyvm,auto,empty,default,none,empty=empty --operation=vm-attach --cn=TESTCLOUD --uuid=D4A55D6A-9D9A-54A2-9907-1FE2C0C6976D --daemon".

Waited for 1 seconds.
The following ATTACHED VMs are in this experiment (Cloud TESTCLOUD) :
|name          |role                |size        |cloud_ip        |host_name                  |vmc_pool      |netname    |ai      |aidrs      |uuid

Going to wait until the value on counter "VM ARRIVED" is equal to 8 (currently it is equal to 6) waiting 1.0 seconds between samples, for a maximum of 36000.0 seconds. The counter is assumed to be increasing.
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVED" equals 6 after 0.931554079056 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVED" equals 6 after 1.93155407906 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVED" equals 7 after 2.93155407906 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVED" equals 8 after 3.93155407906 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
Waited 3.93155407906 seconds until "VMs ARRIVED" was equal to 8.
