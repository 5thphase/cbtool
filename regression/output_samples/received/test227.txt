Waited for 8 seconds.
Message "vm_12;continue;something" published on channel "staging" (object "VM").
Going to wait until the value on counter "VM ARRIVING" is equal to 0 (currently it is equal to 1) waiting 1.0 seconds between samples. The counter is assumed to be decreasing.
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 1 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 2 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 3 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 4 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 5 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 6 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 0 after 7 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
Waited 7 seconds until "VMs ARRIVING" was equal to 0.
