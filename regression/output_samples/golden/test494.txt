Waited for 8 seconds.
Message "vm_12;continue;something" published on channel "staging" (object "VM").
Going to wait until the value on counter "VM ARRIVING" is equal to 0 (currently it is equal to 1) waiting 1.0 seconds between samples, for a maximum of 36000.0 seconds. The counter is assumed to be decreasing.
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 0.937482118607 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 1.93748211861 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 1 after 2.93748211861 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
