Background operation execution success. Operation "vm-attach" will be processed asynchronously, through the command "/home/msilva/cloudbench/lib/operations//../../cbact --procid=TEST_msilva --osp=port:6379,experiment_inst:TEST_msilva,host:172.16.0.4,pid:TEST_msilva,dbid:10,timout:70,protocol:TCP,kind:redis,username:msilva --msp=port:27017,password:cbpwdZ9,timeout:240,host:172.16.0.4,pid:TEST_msilva,database:metrics,protocol:TCP,kind:mongodb,username:msilva --oop=TESTCLOUD,willfail,auto,empty,default,none,empty=empty --operation=vm-attach --cn=TESTCLOUD --uuid=4BD9ABCF-BE31-5BC0-8C95-EC3629FA937E --daemon". The process id is 10232.

Going to wait until the value on counter "VM ARRIVING" is equal to 0 (currently it is equal to 1) waiting 1.0 seconds between samples, for a maximum of 36000.0 seconds. The counter is assumed to be decreasing.
 status: Counter "VM ARRIVING" equals 0 after 0.568938016891 seconds (the counter is assumed to be decreasing).
Waited 0.568938016891 seconds until "VMs ARRIVING" was equal to 0.
