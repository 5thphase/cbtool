Going to wait until the value on counter "AI ARRIVED" is equal to 30 (currently it is equal to 29) waiting 5.0 seconds between samples, for a maximum of 36000.0 seconds. The counter is assumed to be increasing.
 status: Counter "AI ARRIVED" equals 29 after 4.27173304558 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
 status: Counter "AI ARRIVED" equals 30 after 9.27173304558 seconds (the counter is assumed to be increasing).
Waited 9.27173304558 seconds until "AIs ARRIVED" was equal to 30.
