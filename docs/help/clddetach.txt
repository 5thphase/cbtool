Detaches (i.e., removes) a Cloud from an CloudBench experiment. All objects 
belonging to this cloud (i.e., Virtual Machines, Application Instances) are 
terminated and all Cloud attributes are removed from CloudBench's "Object Store".

Usage: clddetach <cloud name>

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

Example :	
	(Cloudbench) clddetach TESTCLOUD
	Removing the cloud-specific "monitor" and "dashboard" processes from this cloudbench experiment.
