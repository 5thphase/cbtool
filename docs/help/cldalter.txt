Alters (updates) one or more attributes of a cloud currently attached to a 
CloudBench experiment.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached

Usage: cldalter <cloud name> <attribute> <key>=<value>

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

	<attribute> is the name of a set of key,value pair grouped as one "global object".
		The list of global objects can be obtained by the use of the cldshow command.
		If the attribute does not exist, it will be created.

	<key>=<value> represents a list of comma separated key,value pairs for a given
		attribute.

Example :	
	(Cloudbench) cldalter TESTCLOUD admission_control ai_max_reservations=20000
	The attribute "admission_control" on Cloud TESTCLOUD was modified:
	|"sub-attribute" (key)                |old value                          |new value                          
	|ai_max_reservations                  |100000                             |20000
