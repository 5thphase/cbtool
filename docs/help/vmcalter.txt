Alters (updates) one or more attributes of a VMC (belonging to a Cloud) 
currently attached to a CloudBench experiment.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached.

Usage: vmcalter <cloud name> <attribute1>=<value1>,<attribute2>=<value2>,...,<attributeN>=<valueN> <vmc identifier> 

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

	<attribute1>=<value1> is a comma-separated attribute list of attribute,value 
		pairs to be altered. If the attribute does not exist, it will be created.

	<vmc identifier> is the cloud-specific name of the VMC, as listed in the cloud configuration
		file (e.g., "RegionOne", "Rack3", "Host3").

Example :	
	(Cloudbench) vmcalter TESTCLOUD cpu_overcommit=2.0 test_host1
	The following attributes for the VMC object were changed (Cloud TESTCLOUD):
	|attribute                              |old value                          |new value                          
	|cpu_overcommit                         |1.5                                |2.0
