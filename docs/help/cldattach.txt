Attaches (i.e., instantiates) a new cloud, effectively starting a CloudBench 
experiment. Parses a "cloud defaults " file (containing cloud attributes/key,value 
pairs) and loads it on CloudBench's "Object Store".

This is the first command that has to be executed on an experiment, and its 
execution is idempotent. If this command is applied to an already attached cloud,
it will just return a success message.

Usage: cldattach <cloud model> <cloud name> [definitions file]

	<cloud model> is a three letter acronym that design the cloud type
		Currently, the following cloud types are supported:"
        nac - Cloudbench nanocloud
		emc - Cloudbench emulated cloud
		sim - Cloudbench simulated cloud
		scp1 - IBM Smart Cloud Provisioning 1.X
		scp2 - IBM Smart Cloud Provisioning 2.X
		sce - IBM Smart Cloud Enterprise
		ec2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
		osk - OpenStack (Essex release only)

	[definitions file] is the string contents of a configuration file
		If omitted, cloudbench will look for the following file names:
			<username>_cloud_defaults.txt
			cloud_defaults.txt

	<cloud name> is an arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.

Example :	
	(Cloudbench) cldattach sim TESTCLOUD
 	status: Checking if services are running (may take a while the first time)...
	The "sim" named "TESTCLOUD" was successfully attached to this cloudbench experiment. The instance identifier is TEST_cbrtuser:TESTCLOUD. The experiment identifier is EXP_06_13_2012_05_35_55_AM_EDT
	(Cloudbench)
