Sets a default cloud for a CloudBench experiment.

If a default cloud is set, the <cloud name> parameter required by any other command
becomes optional

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached

Usage: clddefault <cloud name>

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.

Example :	
	(Cloudbench) clddefault TESTCLOUD
	Default cloud set to "TESTCLOUD". From now on, all commands will assume this
	as the value of the otherwise mandatory <cloud name> parameter
	(Cloudbench)
