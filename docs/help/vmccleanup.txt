Cleans up (i.e., remove all leftover VMs) from a VMCs (belonging to a Cloud) 
currently attached to a CloudBench experiment.

This command can only be executed after at least one cloud was attached.

Usage: vmccleanup <cloud name> <vmc identifier> 

	<cloud name> is the arbitrary name used to identify this cloud within the experiment.
		If a default cloud was set through the command "clddefault <cloud name>"
		then this parameter becomes optional.

	<vmc identifier> is the cloud-specific name of the VMC, as listed in the cloud configuration
		file (e.g., "RegionOne", "Rack3", "Host3").

Examples :	
	(Cloudbench) vmccleanup TESTCLOUD test_host1
	VMC object named "test_host1" was sucessfully cleaned up on this cloudbench experiment.
