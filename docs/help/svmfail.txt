Prematurely failover an existing pair of FT replicated objects.

This command is identical to 'svmdetach vm_X fail'
This is because 'detaching' the SVM object needs to go through
the proper procedures regardless whether or not we are actually failing over
the primary VM or simply deactivating FT replication for the primary VM.
In either case, significant changes happen in the datastore.
